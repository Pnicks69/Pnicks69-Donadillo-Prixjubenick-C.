Chapter 2: Creating a Hello World App

	This chapter walked me trough creating my flutter app, a simple 'Hello World' application. I became familiar with hot reload for quick iterations, themes for app styling, and the distinction between stateless and stateful widgets. I also learned how to integrate external packages to extend app functionality.
