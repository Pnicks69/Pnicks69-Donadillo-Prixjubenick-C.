I installed the Flutter SDK, which allows for cross-platform app development for iOS, Android, web, and desktop using a single codebase,
with Dart as the programming language. I also installed the Flutter plugin, which enhances development by enabling hot reloading, running, and 
debugging directly within my IDE, making the development process faster and more dynamic. The Dart plugin helps with code analysis, validation, and
completion, providing instant feedback and error-checking. Additionally, I set up Android Studio, the primary IDE for Android development,
which also supports Flutter with the necessary plugins for building, testing, and deploying apps on Android and other platforms.
